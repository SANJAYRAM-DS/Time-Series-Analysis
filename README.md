# Time-Series-Analysis
Welcome to the **Time Series Analysis Projects Repository**. This repo contains multiple mini-projects that apply various time series forecasting and analysis techniques to real-world datasets.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a separate project:

- **Airmiles**: Forecasting international air passenger miles.
- **Bitcoin**: Analyzing and predicting Bitcoin price trends.
- **Customer Complaints**: Time series trend analysis of customer complaint volumes.
- **Powergrid**: Load forecasting and anomaly detection in power grid usage.
- **Tesla**: Stock price prediction using traditional and ML-based methods.

---

## 🛠 Techniques & Tools Used

- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `prophet`, `pmdarima`
- **Methods**:
  - Data cleaning & preprocessing
  - Visualization (line plots, autocorrelation, decomposition)
  - Stationarity checks (ADF/KPSS test)
  - Seasonal Decomposition (STL, Classical)
  - Forecasting models: 
    - ARIMA / SARIMA / SARIMAX  
    - Prophet  
  - Model evaluation (RMSE, MAE)

## 📦 Datasets

- **Airmiles**: Built-in dataset or sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) / UCI.
- **Bitcoin**: Historical price data from Yahoo Finance or [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/).
- **Customer Complaints**: Time series complaints data, potentially from a call center or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- **Powergrid**: Smart meter or load dataset for energy usage.
- **Tesla**: Tesla stock price data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).

> **Note:** Please refer to each folder for specific dataset sources and usage rights.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timeseries-projects.git
   cd timeseries-projects

````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run a project**

   * Navigate to the desired folder (`cd Tesla`, for example).
   * Open the notebook:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   * Or run the Python script directly:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Improve forecasting accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
* Add LSTM/GRU-based deep learning models
* Build interactive dashboards using Streamlit or Dash
* Apply walk-forward validation for time series
